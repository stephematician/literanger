#' \pkg{literanger}: Random forests for multiple imputation algorithms.
#'
#' 'literanger' is an adaption of the 'ranger' R package for training and
#' predicting from random forest models within multiple imputation algorithms.
#' ranger is a fast implementation of random forests (Breiman, 2001) or
#' recursive partitioning, particularly suited for high dimensional data
#' (Wright et al, 2017a). literanger enables random forests to be embedded in
#' the fully conditional specification framework for multiple imputation known
#' as 'Multiple Imputation via Chained Equations' (Van Buuren 2007).
#'
#' literanger trains classification and regression forests. The trained forest
#' retains information about the in-bag responses in each terminal node, thus
#' facilitating computationally efficient prediction within multiple imputation
#' with random forests proposed by Doove et al (2014). This multiple imputation
#' algorithm has better predictive distribution properties than competing
#' approaches which use predictive mean matching. Alternatively, the usual
#' bagged prediction may be used as in the imputation algorithm called
#' 'missForest' (Stekhoven et al, 2014).
#'
#' Classification and regression forests are implemented as in the original
#' Random Forest (Breiman, 2001) or using extremely randomized trees (Geurts et
#' al, 2006). "data.frame", "matrix", and sparse matrices ("dgCmatrix") are
#' supported.
#'
#' Split selection may be based on improvement in metrics such as the variance,
#' Gini impurity, beta log-likelihood (Weinhold et al, 2019), Hellinger distance
#' (Cieslak et al, 2012) or maximally selected rank statistics (Wright et
#' al, 2017b).

#' For alternative approaches to multiple imputation that employ random forests,
#' see 'missRanger' <https://cran.r-project.org/package=missRanger> and
#' 'miceRanger' <https://cran.r-project.org/package=miceRanger>, which use
#' predictive mean matching combined with the original 'ranger' algorithm.
