Description: An updated implementation of R package 'ranger'. 'ranger' is a fast
    implementation of random forests, particularly suited for high dimensional
    data. Ensembles of classification and regression (prediction) trees are
    supported by this update. Sparse data of class 'dgCMatrix' (R package
    'Matrix') can be directly analyzed. Predictions are either aggregated or
    given by random draws from in-bag data from a random tree for each new data
    point. This latter prediction is useful for the Multiple Imputation by
    Chained Equations (known as MICE) algorithm in Doove, L. L., Van Buuren, S.,
    & Dusseldorp, E. (2014), "Recursive partitioning for missing data imputation
    in the presence of interaction effects." Computational statistics & data
    analysis, 72, pp. 92-104. Survival and probability forests are not supported
    in the update, nor is data of class 'gwaa.data' (R package 'GenABEL'); use
    the original 'ranger' package for these analyses.
