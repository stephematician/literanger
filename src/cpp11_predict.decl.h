/** Fit a random forest
 *
 * @param[in] x The predictor data as a numeric matrix; each column is a
 * predictor and each row is an observation (or case).
 * @param[in] sparse_x Optional (set to NULL in R to disable); the predictor
 * data represented using a sparse matrix structure, same layout as in \p x, but
 * the underlying data structure more compactly represents matrices with lots of
 * zeros.
 * @param[in] prediction_type The type of prediction, either "bagged", "inbag"
 * or "nodes" (currently not supported); "bagged" predictions take the majority
 * vote or mean from all trees for each row in @p x ; "inbag" draws one in-bag
 * value from a random tree for each row; "nodes" returns the keys (ids) for the
 * terminal node from every tree for each row.
 * @param[in] seed Seed used for (seeding) pseudo-random number generators for
 * each tree.
 * @param[in] n_thread The number of threads to use for training, if zero then
 * the number of threads will be the value returned by
 * `std::thread::hardware_concurrency`.
 * @param[in] verbose Indicator for additional printed output while growing and
 * predicting.
 *
 * @returns A list (in R) with:
 * -   `values`: the predicted value(s) for each node, depending on prediction
 *     type and tree type. For "bagged" and "inbag" @p prediction_type, a
 *     numeric value for each row.
